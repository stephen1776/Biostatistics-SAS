# Biostatistics with SAS

## Description ##
This is my collection of SAS codes that I wrote (or generated) using SAS University edition to solve the problems from the textbook [Biostatistics by Example Using SAS Studio](https://www.sas.com/store/books/categories/getting-started/biostatistics-by-example-using-sas-studio/prodBK_69328_en.html) by Ron Cody.

Note: I used SAS University edition
